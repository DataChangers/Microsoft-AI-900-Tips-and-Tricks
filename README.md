# Microsoft-AI-900-Tips-and-Tricks

## Tips and tricks on the Microsoft AI-900 exam

The [Microsoft AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-900) teaches you to describe the following: 

- AI workloads and considerations; 
- fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure; 
- features of computer vision workloads on Azure; 
- features of Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads on Azure; 
- and features of conversational AI workloads on Azure. 

This exam can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like **Azure Data Scientist Associate** or **Azure AI Engineer Associate**, although you can do these certifications without this exam. For people that are new to the field, it might be of great help!

## What does the Microsoft AI-900 exam ask you to know?

If you want to do the Azure AI Fundamentals certification, you should have foundational knowledge of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) concepts and related Microsoft Azure services. This certification is an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of common ML and AI workloads and how to implement them on Azure.
It's intended for candidates with both technical and non-technical backgrounds. Data science and software engineering experience are not required; however, some general programming knowledge or experience would be beneficial.

## What can you do to get prepare yourself for the Microsoft AI-900 exam?

### Take the recommended Microsoft Learn courses

I created a [Microsoft Learn Course Collection for the Microsoft AI-900 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/mariandragt-datachangers/collections/yjxzij0j6j6eyj), which contains 5 learning paths.

An important recommendation would be to really **do the labs**. That means that you have to make sure that you really understand what you do.

- **Own it**. If possible, make the labs in your own environment. It i great that Microsoft Learn offers you sometimes a fully prepared VM, but it might be nice to check your labs later on when you are preparing for your exam.
- **Make it your own**. It might be sometimes easier to “just click”, especially when you are offered to click to get the right code. It takes more time, but when possible, I would recommend you to write the required code yourself.
- **Go one step further**. There are a lot of links to the Microsoft documentation during your path. Take that opportunity and click on them. 

If you want to review the labs, the easy way is to go to the corresponding GitHub [AI-900 Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Exercises](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai900) repo. Clone this repo, and in the folder “instructions” you will find all the labs.

### Take an instructor-led training

If you have the opportunity and resources, take an [instructor-led training](https://thellpa.com/) In case you struggle with the labs or are facing other challenges, they are there for you to help. And it is wonderful to focus on just your training for a few days. I know, that’s not an option for everyone, but in case you get such an opportunity: take it!

The other benefit of an instructor-led training, is that in many cases, the option to practice your exam is included.

#### Practice your Microsoft AI-900 exam

If you are not able to take an instructor-led-training, you can use an [external party](https://www.measureup.com/) to practice this exam with. Although the questions on the real exam are not the same as those from the practice test, it helps you to get a good idea of what you need to know. Besides, you get a lot of information from the answer section, providing you with very useful links.

I hope this overview will help you to prepare your Microsoft AI-900 exam!
